# RedPad
RedPad is a minimalistic Code Editor for Assembly and C written in C# and .NetFramework 4.7.2

## Why
I just needed a minimalistic and distraction free code editor for assembly and c programming on windows with the ability to launch .bat files. So i have written one qickly.

## Features
- Copy, Paste, Cut, Find with standard keyboard shortcuts (ctrl+c, ctrl+v, ctrl+x, ctrl+f)
- Code highlighting (for c and assembly)
- Code folding
- define and run a *task.bat* from the editor
